Connect Four

Technologies used - HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Javascript.

Connect Four is a simple two player game similar to tic-tac-toe. Only instead of trying to get three in a row, you win by getting four in a row. The players can win by either getting a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Each player will take turns dropping a chip in a column, and whoever connects four chips first wins!
The game will end in a tie if all spaces are filled up and no winners were found.
